MTASC is a free and open source ActionScript2 compiler developed by Nicolas Cannasse at Motion-Twin. It's widely used by many Flash professionals around the world.

MTASC does not require the Flash IDE : it will compile `.as` files into a ```.swf``` containing the flash bytecode. If you want to add additionnal resources, you can either build an input SWF with Flash IDE or with other open source tools such as [SWFMill](http://swfmill.org/).
